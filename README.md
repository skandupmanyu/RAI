# Software Engineering for Data Scientists

This training is designed to help Data Scientists gain valuable skills in Software Engineering.

## 1. Description

### 1.1 Business case

The demo project used to make you practice the training's concepts is about predicting future sales for a **fictive retail company named ACME Inc.**

Based on historical data, our ML model must be able to predict the sales volume for a given product, **for the coming week.**

### 1.2 Data

The `data/` directory contains fake data representing ACME Inc.'s sales on a 3-year period.
 
- `products.csv` contains a list of 100 products, sold in different stores,
- `sotres.csv` contains a list of 10 stores which sell the aforementioned products,
- `transactions.csv` contains more than 1 million data points from May 2016 to May 2019, listing how many units of a given product where sold in a given store on a given day.

`NOTE`

> This data is totally fake. Consequently, the evaluation metrics values are meaningless. The goal is not to improve them!
